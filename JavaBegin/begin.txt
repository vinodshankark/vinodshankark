Java Begin:
-----------
JDK:
----
Java Development Kit. It is environment for developing Java application.
	JDK contains JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which contains libraries and classes to develop application, inside it contains JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Responsible for executing Java program.
Please use LTS (long term support)

Compile and Run Java Code:
-------------------------
javac Main.java
java Main

Package:
--------
Allows to group and organize java files.

Java Comments:
--------------
Comments are useful to document and ignored when we run Java program.
1. //Single line comment
2. /* 
	Multiline comment 
	*/

Variables:
----------
Conceptually its a box which can store anything.

Premitive Datatype and Reference Datatype

Class and Object
-------------------
-------------------
Using class we can create Object.

class A {}

A obj = new A(); 
// obj = Reference. 
// new A() is Object. New keyword provides space in heap memory.
// A() is constructor.

Constructor
-----------
static methods dont need object to call.
Constructor is 
1. member method 
2. Same name as class name 
3. Doesnt return anything.
4. Used allocate memory for object.

public A() {}
public A(int a) {} 
public A(int a, float b) {}


Modifiers in java
-----------------
With class you can use only public, abstract and final
private and protected cannot be used, I may be used inside class.


If variable declared any of the below,
private: specific class.
default: specific Package.
public: Any class or package.
protected: subsidising class.

Static keyword
--------------
With Static keyword dont need to instantiate class. Static variables or methods can be acceesed directly.

Usage is Classname.member.

All non-static members share same static variables.

Static Block
-------------
Its a block which executed when class is loaded into JVM. It is executed before main method
static {}
